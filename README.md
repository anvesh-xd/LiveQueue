# LiveQueue
LiveRequest is a real‑time web application that allows patrons at live venues to submit song requests digitally while DJs manage and respond to those requests through a live dashboard.  The project explores real‑time systems, multi‑user workflows, API integrations, and full‑stack application architecture.
